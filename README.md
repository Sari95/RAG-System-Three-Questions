## Mini RAG Retrieval Experiment

This repository contains a minimal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) setup.

The goal is to isolate and understand the retrieval step by experimenting with different chunk sizes and similarity scores.
There is no chat history, no memory and no LLM-based answer generation.

The code demonstrates how chunking, embeddings and cosine similarity influence retrieval quality in a small, controlled setup.
