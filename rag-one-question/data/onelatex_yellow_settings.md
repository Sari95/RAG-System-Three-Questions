If the background of a text in OneNote is marked in yellow, OneLatex interprets the text as native LaTeX code.

This allows users to write LaTeX commands directly in OneNote, similar to working in a LaTeX editor.

For example, LaTeX commands can be used to insert vertical space or start a new page. Entire tables can also be written manually if the table functionality of OneLatex is not used.

As an alternative to the yellow background color, the same behavior can be achieved by assigning the tag “Project B” to the text.

When copying content to the clipboard, tags such as “Project B” are not preserved. In such cases, the copied content will always use the background color instead of the tag.
