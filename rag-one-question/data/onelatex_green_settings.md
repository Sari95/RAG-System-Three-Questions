If the background of a text in OneNote is highlighted in green, OneLatex interprets the content as settings.

For this to work, the text must be formatted as valid JSON, and the property names must match those used by OneLatex.

Settings can be copied from OneLatex and pasted into OneNote. Once pasted, they appear with a green background.

During the conversion process, OneLatex reads these green-highlighted settings and applies them accordingly.

Additional information about copying and pasting settings is provided in the OneLatex documentation. Further explanations describe how settings are applied in OneLatex and what the individual settings mean.
