OneLatex allows users to create professional documents by writing content in OneNote and converting it into pure LaTeX code.

The main benefit of this approach is that content creation is separated from formatting. Users can focus on writing their ideas in OneNote, while OneLatex handles many complex formatting aspects during the conversion process. For example, links between OneNote pages are automatically converted into document references.

OneLatex uses the structure of OneNote to organize documents. Each OneNote page represents a section or chapter in the final LaTeX document. This provides a clear overview of the document structure and makes reordering chapters easy by simply moving pages in OneNote. This is especially helpful for large documents where restructuring can otherwise become cumbersome.

In addition, OneLatex allows users to keep remarks, notes, hyperlinks, and files directly inside the same OneNote notebook. These supplementary materials can be marked with a blue background and are ignored during conversion. This makes the notebook an all-in-one documentation and collaboration hub without affecting the final LaTeX output.

Overall, OneLatex combines the user-friendly interface of OneNote with the power of LaTeX to provide an efficient workflow for professional document creation.

OneLatex deliberately ignores most formatting, except for bold, underline, and italic text. To ensure correct conversion, the text layout in OneNote should remain simple, using a single font and font size.

Using OneNote style templates such as Heading or Quote will cause the corresponding text blocks to be ignored during conversion. To ensure content is included, the Normal style should be used.
